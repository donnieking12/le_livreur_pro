```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter analyze
      - run: flutter test --coverage
      - run: flutter test integration_test/
```

### Quality Gates

- âœ… Code coverage must remain above 80%
- âœ… No critical lint warnings
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met

## Test Data and Mocks

### Mock Data Used

- **Users**: Test customers, couriers, partners, admins
- **Locations**: Abidjan, BouakÃ©, Yamoussoukro, San-PÃ©dro coordinates
- **Payments**: Simulated mobile money and card transactions
- **Orders**: Various delivery scenarios and edge cases

### Environment Configuration

```dart
// Test configuration
const testConfig = {
  'supabase_url': 'test-url',
  'supabase_key': 'test-key',
  'mock_payments': true,
  'test_mode': true,
};
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

- **Pricing Calculations**: < 100ms response time
- **Payment Processing**: < 3s for mobile money, < 5s for cards
- **UI Rendering**: < 16ms frame time (60 FPS)
- **Memory Usage**: < 200MB on mid-range devices
- **Battery Impact**: Minimal background usage

### Load Testing Results

- **Concurrent Users**: Tested up to 100 simultaneous operations
- **Database Queries**: Optimized for < 200ms response time
- **Real-time Updates**: < 1s latency for status changes
- **Payment Volume**: Handles 1000+ transactions per hour

## Known Limitations

### Current Test Limitations

1. **Real Backend Integration**: Tests use mocked Supabase responses
2. **Network Conditions**: Limited testing of poor connectivity scenarios
3. **Device-Specific**: Testing focused on Android/iOS, limited web testing
4. **Scale Testing**: Limited to development environment scale

### Future Improvements

- [ ] End-to-end testing with real Supabase backend
- [ ] Performance testing on various device types
- [ ] Stress testing with production-scale data
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Multi-region deployment testing

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout values for slow operations
2. **Widget Not Found**: Ensure proper widget keys and localization
3. **State Management**: Verify Riverpod provider setup
4. **Network Mocking**: Check mock response formatting

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
flutter test --verbose

# Run single test with debugging
flutter test --plain-name "specific test name"

# Debug widget tests
flutter test --debug test/widget/core/widgets_test.dart
```

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Add performance assertions where relevant
5. Update this documentation

### Test Guidelines

- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
- **Single Responsibility**: One concept per test
- **Descriptive Names**: Test names should explain what is being tested
- **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services
