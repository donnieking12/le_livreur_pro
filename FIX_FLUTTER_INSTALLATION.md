# Fixing Flutter Installation Issues

The analysis is showing errors in Flutter SDK files themselves, which indicates a corrupted or inconsistent Flutter installation. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Backup Your Project

Before proceeding, make sure your project is backed up:
1. Commit all changes to your version control system
2. Create a backup copy of your project folder

## Step 2: Uninstall Current Flutter SDK

1. Locate your Flutter SDK installation directory (commonly `C:\src\flutter` or `C:\flutter`)
2. Completely delete this folder
3. Remove any Flutter-related entries from your system's PATH environment variable

## Step 3: Download Fresh Flutter SDK

1. Go to the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Download the latest stable version of Flutter SDK for Windows
3. Make sure to download the correct version (as of project requirements: Flutter SDK 3.19.0+)

## Step 4: Extract Flutter SDK

1. Extract the downloaded Flutter SDK to a clean location
2. Recommended paths (avoid spaces in path):
   - `C:\flutter`
   - `C:\Development\flutter`
   - `C:\tools\flutter`

## Step 5: Update Environment Variables

1. Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
2. In System Variables, find and select "Path", then click "Edit"
3. Add the path to Flutter's bin directory (e.g., `C:\flutter\bin`)
4. Click OK to save changes

## Step 6: Restart Your Terminal/IDE

1. Close all terminal windows and your IDE
2. Reopen them to ensure environment variables are updated

## Step 7: Verify Installation

1. Open a new terminal/command prompt
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   flutter doctor
   ```

## Step 8: Reinstall Project Dependencies

After Flutter is properly installed:
1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter analyze
   ```

## Step 9: Test Your Setup

1. Run the configuration check:
   ```bash
   dart simple_check.dart
   ```
2. Test Supabase connection:
   ```bash
   dart test_supabase_connection_env.dart
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Windows PowerShell Execution Policy**:
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. **Clear Flutter Cache**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub cache repair
   ```

3. **Reinstall Dart SDK** (if needed):
   - Download from: https://dart.dev/get-dart
   - Follow installation instructions

## Expected Outcome

After completing these steps, you should be able to:
1. Run `flutter --version` without errors
2. Run `flutter doctor` and see all checks pass
3. Run `flutter pub get` successfully
4. Run `flutter analyze` and see only project-specific issues (not SDK errors)
5. Run your configuration check scripts without Flutter SDK errors
