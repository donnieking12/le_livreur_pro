# Le Livreur Pro - Next Steps After Git Push

## After Successfully Pushing Changes

Congratulations on completing the development environment setup! Here are the next steps to continue with your development journey.

### 1. Build the Windows Application

Run the following PowerShell script to build the Windows application:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_windows.ps1
```

This script will:
- Clean previous builds
- Get dependencies
- Run CMake with the correct Visual Studio generator
- Build the Release version of the application

### 2. Run the Application

After the build is complete, run the application:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_app.ps1
```

### 3. Explore the Codebase

The main application code is located in the `lib/` directory:
- `lib/main.dart` - Entry point of the application
- `lib/core/` - Core business logic, models, services, and configuration
- `lib/features/` - Feature modules (auth, orders, courier, restaurant, admin, tracking)
- `lib/shared/` - Shared components, theme, and utilities

### 4. Run Tests

To run unit tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

To run widget tests:
```bash
flutter test test/widget
```

To run integration tests:
```bash
flutter test test/integration
```

### 5. Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch for your feature**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

3. **Run tests to ensure nothing is broken**:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
