# Next Steps for Le Livreur Pro Setup

## Current Status

You have successfully completed the initial configuration of your Le Livreur Pro application:
- ✅ Supabase credentials configured
- ✅ Environment file created with your project details
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ Verification tools and helper scripts ready

## ⚠️ Important Notice

During the setup process, we identified critical issues with your Flutter installation. The analysis is showing errors in Flutter SDK files themselves, which indicates a corrupted or inconsistent Flutter installation. This must be fixed before proceeding with the rest of the setup.

**Please follow the steps in [FIX_FLUTTER_INSTALLATION.md](file:///c%3A/Development/le_livreur_pro/FIX_FLUTTER_INSTALLATION.md) to resolve this issue.**

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Execute Database Schema in Supabase

This is the most critical next step to get your application working.

**Follow the detailed guide**: [SUPABASE_SCHEMA_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md](file:///c%3A/Development/le_livreur_pro/SUPABASE_SCHEMA_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md)

**Steps**:
1. Go to [https://app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Sign in and select your project (`fnygxppfogfpwycbbhsv`)
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Copy the content from `supabase_schema.sql` in your project
5. Paste and execute in Supabase SQL Editor
6. Verify success with the queries provided in the guide

### 2. Test Database Connection

After executing the schema, verify the connection works:

```bash
dart test_supabase_connection.dart
```

### 3. Install Flutter Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run Verification Script

```bash
dart check_setup.dart
```

## Short-term Goals

### Configure Additional Services

1. **Google Maps API** (required for location features):
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Enable required APIs (Maps SDK, Directions, Geocoding, Places)
   - Create an API key
   - Add to your [.env](file:///c%3A/Development/le_livreur_pro/.env.template) file:
     ```
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
     ```

2. **Payment Gateways** (optional for initial testing):
   - Obtain credentials for Orange Money, MTN Money, and Wave
   - Add to [.env](file:///c%3A/Development/le_livreur_pro/.env.template)

### Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
flutter test test/unit/

# Widget tests
flutter test test/widget/

# Integration tests
flutter test test/integration/
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
flutter run
```

### Web Mode

```bash
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

### Mobile Mode

With a connected device or emulator:
```bash
flutter run -d <device-name>
```

On Windows, you can also use the startup script:
```bash
start_dev.bat
```

Or the PowerShell helper:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_helper.ps1
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Initial data inserted (4 test users)
- [ ] Database connection test passes
- [ ] Flutter dependencies installed
- [ ] Configuration verification passes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the detailed logs** from any failed commands
2. **Review the setup documentation**:
   - [SUPABASE_CONFIG.md](file:///c%3A/Development/le_livreur_pro/SUPABASE_CONFIG.md)
