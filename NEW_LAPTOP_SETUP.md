# ðŸ”„ New Laptop Setup Guide for Le Livreur Pro

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the Le Livreur Pro project on your new laptop. Based on the `flutter doctor` output, we need to address a few missing components.

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- At least 8GB RAM
- At least 20GB free disk space

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio for Windows Development

Since you want to develop Windows apps, you need Visual Studio with C++ build tools:

1. Download Visual Studio Community from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. During installation, make sure to select the "Desktop development with C++" workload
3. Include all default components in this workload
4. Complete the installation

## Step 2: Fix Android Toolchain (Optional)

If you want to develop for Android as well:

1. Install Android Studio if not already installed
2. Open Android Studio and go to SDK Manager
3. In the SDK Tools tab, make sure to install:
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools
4. Accept Android licenses by running:
   ```
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```

## Step 3: Verify Project Setup

After installing the required tools, verify your setup:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\HP\Desktop\Donnie\le_livreur_pro
   ```

2. Run flutter doctor to check if all issues are resolved:
   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

3. Get project dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Try building for Windows:
   ```
   flutter build windows
   ```

## Step 4: Environment Configuration

Your project already has the required environment files:
- `.env` - Contains the configuration values
- `.env.template` - Template for new setups

The current configuration includes:
- Supabase credentials for backend services
- Google Maps API key placeholder
- Payment gateway API keys

## Step 5: Running the Application

Once everything is set up, you can run the application:

For Windows:
```
flutter run -d windows
```

For Web:
```
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you encounter build errors:
1. Clean the project:
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

### If you have issues with asset loading:
1. Make sure all asset directories exist:
   - `assets/images/delivery/`
   - `assets/images/payment/`
   - `assets/icons/`
   - `assets/lottie/`
   - `assets/translations/`

### If you have issues with environment variables:
1. Verify that the `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Make sure it contains valid Supabase credentials

## Next Steps

1. Install Visual Studio with C++ build tools
2. Run `flutter doctor` to verify the installation
3. Try building the Windows application
4. Test the application functionality

## Additional Notes

- The project is already configured with Supabase credentials
- You may want to replace the Google Maps API key with your own for production
- Payment gateway keys are placeholders and need to be replaced for production use
