# Complete Development Setup Guide for Le Livreur Pro

## Overview
This guide will help you set up a complete development environment for the Le Livreur Pro project. Based on our verification, most components are already in place, but we need to install Visual Studio to enable Windows development.

## Current Status
✅ Flutter environment: Installed and configured
✅ Project dependencies: All installed
✅ Configuration files: Properly set up
✅ Asset structure: Complete and correct
❌ Visual Studio: Needs installation for Windows development

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio with C++ Build Tools

#### Download and Install Visual Studio Community
1. Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. Download "Visual Studio Community" (free for individual developers)
3. Run the downloaded installer

#### Select Required Workloads
During installation, make sure to select:
- **Desktop development with C++**
  - MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
  - Windows 10/11 SDK (latest version)
  - CMake tools for C++
  - C++ profiling tools

#### Complete Installation
1. Click "Install" and wait for the installation to complete
2. This process may take 30-60 minutes depending on your internet connection
3. Restart your computer after installation

### Step 2: Verify Visual Studio Installation

After restarting your computer, verify the installation:

1. Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd c:\Users\HP\Desktop\Donnie\le_livreur_pro
   ```
3. Run:
   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

You should see a checkmark (✅) next to "Visual Studio - develop Windows apps".

### Step 3: Test Windows Build

Once Visual Studio is properly installed:

1. Clean any previous build artifacts:
   ```
   flutter clean
   ```

2. Get dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Try building for Windows:
   ```
   flutter build windows
   ```

This should complete successfully without errors.

### Step 4: Run the Application

After successful build, you can run the application:

```
flutter run -d windows
```

This will launch the Le Livreur Pro application on your Windows desktop.

## Optional: Android Development Setup

If you also want to develop for Android:

### Install Android SDK Command-line Tools
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to SDK Manager (File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK)
3. In the SDK Tools tab, make sure to install:
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools

### Accept Android Licenses
