   Run the following command to push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Build the Windows Application**:
   After pushing, run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_windows.ps1
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After building, run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_app.ps1
   ```

## Verification

To verify that your changes have been committed but not yet pushed, you can run:
```bash
git status
```

You should see a message indicating that your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with pushing:

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Verify you have write permissions to the repository**
3. **If using HTTPS and prompted for credentials, enter your GitHub username and personal access token**
4. **If using SSH, ensure your SSH key is properly configured**

## Development Ready

Once you've successfully pushed your changes, your development environment will be completely set up and ready for Le Livreur Pro development.

You can then:
- Start exploring the codebase in the `lib/` directory
- Run tests using `flutter test`
- Make code changes and commit them using the standard Git workflow
- Build and run the application on Windows
