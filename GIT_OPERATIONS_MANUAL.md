# Le Livreur Pro - Git Operations Manual

## Manual Git Commands

Since we're experiencing issues with automated scripts, here are the manual commands you need to run:

### 1. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### 2. Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Environment setup completion: Added verification scripts and documentation"
```

### 4. Push to Remote Repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Using Git GUI

If command-line git is not working, you can use a Git GUI tool:

1. Open GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, or another Git GUI tool
2. Open the repository folder: `c:\Users\HP\Desktop\Donnie\le_livreur_pro`
3. Stage all changes
4. Commit with message: "Environment setup completion: Added verification scripts and documentation"
5. Push to remote repository

## Files That Should Be Committed

The following files were created during the setup process and should be committed:

1. `setup_verification.txt` - Setup verification file
2. `DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS.md` - Environment status report
3. `SCRIPTS_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Guide for using helper scripts
4. `SETUP_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Setup completion summary
5. `build_windows.ps1` - Windows build script
6. `run_app.ps1` - Application run script
7. `dev_setup_assistant.ps1` - Interactive setup assistant
8. `verify_vs_installation.ps1` - Visual Studio verification script
9. `git_status_check.ps1` - Git status check script
10. `final_verification.ps1` - Final verification script
11. `verify_and_push.bat` - Batch file for verification and push

## Next Steps After Git Push

After successfully pushing the changes, proceed with:

1. **Build the Windows application**:
   - Run `build_windows.ps1` in PowerShell

2. **Test the application**:
   - Run `run_app.ps1` in PowerShell

3. **Begin development**:
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)
   - Start exploring the codebase in the `lib/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into your Git client
2. Check that you have write permissions to the repository
3. If using HTTPS, you may need to enter your credentials
4. If using SSH, make sure your SSH key is properly configured

### If you get merge conflicts:
1. Run `git pull origin main` to fetch the latest changes
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Commit and push again

### If you get "nothing to commit":
1. Run `git status` to see if there are any changes
2. If no changes, you're already up to date
